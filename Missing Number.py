# Approach: Set Difference (Finding the missing number)
# - This approach creates a list of all numbers from 0 to n (where n is the length of nums).
# - The difference between this list and the given nums list is computed to find the missing number.

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Get the length of nums
        a = len(nums)
        list1 = []
        
        # Generate a list of numbers from 0 to a
        for i in range(0, a + 1):
            list1.append(i)
        
        # Find the missing number by computing the difference between the two sets
        missing = list(set(list1) - set(nums))
        
        # Return the first element from the result (since only one number is missing)
        return missing[0]

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.missingNumber([3, 7, 1, 2, 8, 4, 5]))  # Output: 6

# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the nums list.
# - Creating the set and finding the difference takes O(n) time.
# Space Complexity: O(n), as we are storing the set of numbers and the list of all numbers from 0 to n.
